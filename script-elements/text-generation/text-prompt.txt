Explain something about firewalls:

By default, firewalls block traffic from the WAN to the LAN. 

This sounds like it means that no external traffic can come into the network. 

But clearly that is not the case: if you browse a website, you are sending requests to servers which are then streaming content which you are receiving locally and rendering in  a web browser.

How to firewalls manage to do this? And to provide security against random connections from the outside while allowing safe/normal usage?
